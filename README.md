# indelux-landing
This contains a landing webpage for my business "Indelux Lighting"
So I already cloned this git repository to my local computer, tried deleting it but theres is this message "override r--r--r-- benjaminjacome/staff for Web-Projects//indelux-landing/.git/objects/pack/pack-7585f7e145654c3156970f33860de87783d312e0.idx?". Then it doesn't close so I have to close it with (ctrl + c). What's confusing me is that I don't seem to find ths README.md file on the local repository but hete, it's still here. Is it because I deleted everything except the .git directory?.

Let's Check.

I was stupidly confused because my page was so small, and I tried googling and stuff. After some research I saw that my page was zoomed at 15% so that's why it looked so small. Well I can continue working after 3 days lol. Also I'm on vacation so that's why I haven't been able to put this my all. Cheers.
